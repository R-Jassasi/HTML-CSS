    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thought about it?</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base id doesn't work?</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messsed up too?</h4>
    <hr>

<!-- This is how you add notes -->    
    <p>Making a pizza is similar to coding. 
    There are certain things we have to do first. 
    Like making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, 
    add the sauce, add the toppings, add the cheese, bake, 
    and cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start out 
    in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have
    everything you needto make many different pizzas using the same base
    structure that is set up before hand.</p>
